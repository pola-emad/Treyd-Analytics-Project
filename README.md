# Treyd-Analytics

Treyd is a fintech pioneer providing "Sell now, pay later" inventory financing, allowing merchants to pay their suppliers upfront while deferring their own payments.
This project, the Treyd Risk Analytics Engine, is a comprehensive SQL-based framework designed to monitor the health of Treyd’s funding portfolio. It transforms raw transactional data into high-stakes business intelligence—covering Merchant Credit Risk, Supplier Reliability, Cohort Growth, and Portfolio Concentration. By bridging the gap between raw data and executive decision-making, this engine identifies capital exposure, detects operational bottlenecks, and ensures the long-term sustainability of the financing model.
